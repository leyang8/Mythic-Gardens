## Game Design - Story Line:

In the lost world of the Mythic Gardens lies treasures of riches from the late descents. However, the frenzy for the glory and fame isn’t for the faint-hearted; it's a treacherous journey that demands one to traverse through the perilous terrain. Only those who can overcome the fearful gatekeepers and prove themselves worthy can unlock the enigmatic secrets of the Mythic Gardens. It's a test of wit, courage, and skill, where one must navigate through the labyrinthine puzzles and unravel the cryptic codes that guard the treasures of the past. The gatekeepers are relentless and unforgiving, its terrains are guarded to test- a true dance with danger where missteps could be fatal. Above and beyond its dystopian guise, the rewards are unparalleled, and the legends of triumphs will echo through the ages. The Mythic Gardens beckon, will you answer the call?

## How Game Works:

Welcome to the thrilling world of the Mythic Gardens, where players take on the role of a daring hero in search of treasure and glory. The game begins at level one, where the main character is controlled by the user's keyboard (up, left, right keys), allowing them to navigate the perilous terrain of the lost world. Along the way, the hero must face fearsome monsters from different sizes. Small monsters will be randomly moving around while the one large monster will be following the main character as he moves.

Each enemy encounter is a battle of blood and steel, with the main character and their opponent each having a blood level that decreases with each hit from a weapon and each collision. If the main character's blood level reaches zero, the game ends. However, if the enemy's blood level reaches zero, the main character can progress through the level, fighting other enemies until he kills them all to proceed to the next level.

As the main character progresses through each level, the challenges become increasingly difficult, and the enemies more powerful. But fear not, for the hero will also have access to more advanced weapons, making each battle more epic than the last. As the main character unlocks new weapons, the weapons also become more powerful, being able to kill monsters faster than before.

In level one the character has access to only one weapon, the rocks. When the character reaches level 2 he will unlock a new weapon, the fireballs. In level 2 the character will have experience points, the more he kills the more the points increase. When he reaches 60 experience points he will unlock a new weapon, the lasers which are the most powerful weapons.

The user will have the privilege to customize his/her character by giving the character a name at the beginning of the game. To win the game the character must go through two levels and succeed in both to reach the end.

The Mythic Gardens is a true test of skill and endurance, where only the bravest and most skilled can hope to uncover the enigmatic secrets of the past.
